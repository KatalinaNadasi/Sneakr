# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Brand = Brand.create(name: "Adidas")
Shoe = Shoe.create(name:"gazelle", brand: brand, description: "clacladsdsdsdsdsdsd")

#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
